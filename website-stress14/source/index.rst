The International School on Tool-based Rigorous Engineering of Software 
Systems (STRESS) series aims to provide top-quality lectures and
innovative pedagogical material that provide young researchers with:
 
* instruction in existing and emerging formal methods and software 
  engineering techniques that are tool-supported and process-oriented,
  
* insights into how software is developed in the real world, including 
  emphasis on domains such as safety/mission-critical software and
  embedded systems where the development effort associated with tool-based
  formal methods promises greatest returns,
  
* case-studies and example domains in which formal methods have been
  successfully transitioned into actual development along with insights in
  how to bridge the gap between research tools and actual development
  processes, and
  
* additional pedagogical resources and personal contacts that they can
  explore for the purpose of increasing the impact of their research.
 
The theme of the 2014 International School is on **Software Specification**, 
**Verification**, and **Variation**. 
It features lecturers from academic and industry with significant
experience in software contract, software analysis and certification, and
software product lines.
Lectures will emphasize the use of program analyzers and verifiers, 
model-driven development and software architecture tools, and 
industry-relevant challenge problems.

In addition to STRESS 2014, 
the `ISoLA <http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/isola/isola2014/>`__ week 
(`CFP <http://santos.cis.ksu.edu/STRESS/2014/ISoLA14-CFP.pdf>`__)
offers a lot of opportunites besides the standard conference program, 
which addresses in particular also for PhD students:

* The LearnLib tutorial will illustrate the power of test-based modelling, 
  an approach ideally suited to investigate legacy software.
  
* The RERS challenge provides an ideal opportunity to check one's own
  verification competence. During the challenge you will meet world
  leading experts in tool-based software verification.
  http://www.rers-challenge.org
  
* The industrial day will give an impression of today's needs industry.

Finally, there is also a direct and tangible benefit for young scientists:

* The poster session gives PhD students the opportunity to give a 10 minutes
  sketch of their work, which they can later on elaborate on during the breaks.
  One page abstracts of selected contributions will be published in the ISoLA 
  proceedings.

* Moreover, participating PhD student will be invited to contribute to the  
  post conference proceedings published in Springer's CCIS series.
  
  **The deadline for poster presentation is: May 15, 2014**
 
  Later submissions may also be accepted but would be too late for the
  selection process for one page abstracts in the conference proceedings.
